# aBadApple
Arduboy port of Bad Apple!! <br/>
Requires the Arduboy2 library.

Bad Apple!! seems to be the Doom of software portable music videos, and I wanted to contribute another console to the mix.
Rendered at a glorious 16x8 at a mindblowing 4 frames per second. No audio either. 32KB of flash is rough.

You could technically cut out a couple of KB by removing the USB stuff, but that means you have to jam the reset switch to update the console again, and I fear doing that frequently would shear the switch off. <br/>

The frames are generated by running the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lNZ_Rnr7Jc) through ffmpeg with a black 'n white [palette.png](../master/stuff/palette.png) and this command </br>
```
ffmpeg -i badapple.mkv -i palette.png -filter_complex "fps=4,scale=11:8:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse" output.gif
```
to produce a gif. Then you transcribe the gif pixel by pixel, frame by frame into a bit array. Or write a python script for it. :P <br/>
