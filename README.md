Arduboy port of Bad Apple!! <br/>
Requires the Arduboy2 library.

Rendered at a glorious 16x8 at a mindblowing 4 frames per second. No audio either. 32KB of flash is rough.

You could technically cut out a couple of KB by removing the USB stuff, but that means you have to jam the reset switch to update the console again, and I fear doing that frequently would shear the switch off.

Bad Apple!! seems to be the Doom of software portable music videos, and I wanted to contribute another console to the mix.
